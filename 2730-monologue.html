This is not a hospital, this a Paper Store: A short imagined monolouge
    </h1>
<h2>The goal of this assignment was to create a monolouge to make the professor laugh, ala McSweeney’s Internet Tendency. I drew on personal experiences during my time in high school as a sales associate at my local Paper Store where I often encountered people would would rather fight my nine-months pregnant manager than not have their coupon be applied.</h2>
    <p>
	Are you serious? Are you actually looking me dead in the eyes and saying that I need to take my job more seriously? This is The Paper Store. This is not a hospital. 
<p>
You want me, a 16-year-old who works part-time, for a dollar above New Hampshire minimum wage, to act like I’m in an emergency room? Should I prep the jewelry for surgery? You want me to write notes in Vera Bradley’s chart? Oh, and the Hallmark cards are on life support? Please. 
<p>
There are a very limited number of places where people should treat their job with the same carefulness as those who perform medical procedures. First, there are hospitals and the general medical field. Next, we have people who deal with deadly chemicals like lab scientists or whoever sits next to the nuclear launch button. After that, I would say structural engineers. I’m not sure if you noticed, but none of the jobs I listed are sales associates at New England gift retailers. 
<p>
The Paper Store, where you are at this very moment, is meant for the 28-year-old who needs to buy a kitschy gift for their friend’s engagement party that they really don’t want to go to. Or the 16-year-old who just got her license and needs a lanyard for her keys or perhaps a wallet. Perhaps the 62-year-old woman who loves Yankee Candle and buying her grandkids Halloween cards. Do you know what all of the things I just mentioned have in common? They are NOT life or death scenarios. What could possibly be so serious about any of those things that I should treat you like a person who is recovering from a double-lung transplant? Your mid-life crisis is not my problem, nor is your obsession with tacky home decor.  
<p>
Oh, you know what? You’re so right. My mistake! Of course I should override the computer system so that your coupon is valid on that Lily Pulitzer calendar. This is a real emergency! I should probably check your blood pressure and get you an aspirin while I’m at it! It’s totally reasonable that not being able to save a whopping three dollars on a planner would cause you to become unresponsive. How could I be so insensitive? You are looking a little clammy and I think your pupils look dilated. I better go get the AED out of the closet and start chest compressions! How reckless of me to not care about your well-being while you’re clearly in a crisis. Can you tell me when your last period started and the hour of your last bowel movement?
<p>
Let’s say, just for a second, that I took my job more seriously. Do you know what I still could not do? I cannot force you to return your grip on reality. They can’t even be able to do that in an emergency room. Your problem is so specific that a full bloodwork panel, an IV drip, and an ultrasound would be useless to diagnose you. 
<p>
If you genuinely believe that you should yell at any of the employees here, who haven't eaten dinner yet and won’t get to until 10 pm tonight, deserve to be screamed at because the Alex and Ani bracelet you saw in the mailer is out of stock perhaps you should have your head examined. Clearly, you suffer from some sort of delusional disorder. I would say that you’d never treat a nurse, doctor, or other hospital employee like this but judging by your sunglasses it seems clear that your problem is an overall lack of human decency, which has no cure.
