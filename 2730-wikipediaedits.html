<h1>
A summary of Wikipedia Edits
</h1>
<h2>For this assignment, we were tasked with learning the intricacies of Wikipedia-how to edit an article, what the Wikipedia community views as appropriate, how articles get deleted, etc. I chose to work on articles across my varying interest, including Anne Boleyn's page and a niche sports meme page.</h2>

<pb>What were the biggest points of friction? What were the surprises?
    </pb>
    <p>
I knew that is was easy to edit Wikipedia, but I didn’t realize how easy. I think a few years back, I hit the edit button on a page just to see what would happen. Surprise surprise, it was going to actually let me edit the page. I immediately exited out of the tab because I was afraid to do something wrong. I found myself having a similar surprise every time I edited an article during this assignment. “Really? They’re just going to let me edit this sentence on the Anne Boelyn Wikipedia page? I can just add in a source to an article? I can add in my argument for why an obscure meme page should be allowed to stay on the website?”
<p>
Overall, I didn’t feel as if there was a lot of friction in using Wikipedia. The visual editor felt very simple to work with and user friendly, however I’m a design major and I feel comfortable using these types of softwares so I may be somewhat biased. I think that the biggest challenge was understanding the set-up of Wikipedia articles relating to Wikipedia best practices. The Wikipedia Notability Guidelines, for example, felt very convoluted and somewhat difficult to follow. Since so many paragraphs have links in them to lead you to other pages that sometimes said very similar things, it felt like I would fall into a rabbit hole looking at guidelines rather than in articles themselves and I found myself confused at times that certain articles were separated out from one another. In the Notability Guidelines, there was a separate page showing the categorys of Notability Guidelines and then additional pages in that page, and I find myself getting confused just explaining what confused me.

Do you feel like you "know" Wikipedia now? How much does it take for a person to "know" Wikipedia, or to "be" a Wikipedia editor?</pb>
    <p>
I understand much more about Wikipedia now compared to a month ago. I feel confident copy editing and adding information to articles, but I don’t know how secure I’d feel in creating an article or putting an article up for deletion. This is more of a personal issue than a Wikipedia one; I don’t think that the resources Wikipedia offers are confusing, I just think something about them doesn’t compute well in my brain. I think that it definitely takes some time to get to know Wikipedia and understand the ins-and-outs. The amount of time we had in class combined with the modules in the online classroom I thought gave a thorough overview of Wikipedia that allows you to go pretty much anywhere you want with it, but wasn’t so time consuming that I got bored or found myself disinterested in the content. 
</p>
<pb>How should Wikipedia get more editors?</pb>
    <p>
From a business standpoint, the best way for Wikipedia to get more editors would be to launch a PR campaign to teachers and academics that rebrands the site as a reliable source of information and a great way to discover unbiased facts and great sources on a variety of notable topics. This, I think, could lead to an increased use of the Wiki Education and help more people get inspired to become Wikipedia editors. From the standpoint of someone who has learned about Wikipedia and the goals of the site, I recognize that this is not really in keeping with the pillars of Wikipedia. I think that Wikipedia should keep focusing on creating community of people who are dedicated to knowledge. It seems to me like they have several ways already where they implement this, such as the badge you can add to your profile if you are part of the Typo Team. In addition, I think Wikipedia should focus on promoting the knowledge of the Wiki Education tool we used in class. I really enjoyed the unit and it seems like it would fit well into several English courses.
