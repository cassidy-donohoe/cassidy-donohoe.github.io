<h1>
Tudor England’s Page 6: Drama in the Tudor Dynasty told through Gossip Girl Blasts (AI Writing Assignment)
</h1>
<h2>My goal for this assignment was to take a paper I had written for my Tudors/Stuarts Early Modern British History class and make it accessible and humorous. The Tudor dynasty is RIFE with drama and intrigue and I think more people should learn about it. The audience for my original essay was my professor, and the tone was meant to be strictly academic and professional. The goal for this remix originally was to create an Instagram carousel as my adaptation, but I quickly moved to series of news blasts written in the style of the one and only Gossip Girl. I was primarily focused on the length of the end product as well as the tone of the piece, since Gossip Girl has a distinct, iconic voice. I had a lot of fun with this assignment as someone who is always willing to talk about the drama of the mid 1500s in England, although it was hard to condense 100 years of history into seven Gossip Girl blasts.</h2>

    <pb>Beginning of the Tudor Dynasty</pb>
<p>
Hold onto your corsets: change is in the air here in England. Henry Tudor is coming to power, which means a whole new royal family is coming with him. I’ll keep my predictions to myself for now, but I’ve got sources telling me this king is changing up the structure of the royal court already. What could possibly go wrong? It’s not like our religion has ever changed. XOXO, Gossip Girl
    </p>
<pb>Henry VIII and the Religious Flip-Flop</pb>
    <p>
Hey Englishmen. I’m sure you’re all surprised to hear from me given the Cromwellian muzzle that makes it illegal to disagree with the king. But the Royal Supremacy will never stop me from telling you all the hot gossip in the realm. Henry VIII has only been in charge for six years and I’ve watched a divorce and a beheading, I have a feeling a death may be next. Hope you’re all feeling Reformed today–I have a feeling Henry will want us to reform again soon. XOXO, Gossip Girl. 
    </p>
    
<pb>The Death of Henry VIII</pb>
<p>What could possibly be said about Henry VIII that hasn’t already been said? I’ll go first: he was a good king…until his head stopped doing the ruling and everyone else’s heads started rolling. With a new king on deck, is religious consistency coming up to bat soon? I’m getting tired of throwing out my bibles.  XOXO, Gossip Girl. </p>

<pb>Changing Religion (Again) Under Edward VI</pb>
<p>Spotted: Another religious change. We’re back to being Protestants and Edward’s hellbent on us using the Book of Common Prayer at mass. But don’t go book shopping yet–I hear Eddie is sick, and without an heir to the throne, we’ve got a succession crisis on our hands. Anyone burning that book to make popcorn for the sister showdown? Anyone got an unknown horse in the race? XOXO, Gossip Girl</p>

<pb>Ascension of Bloody Mary</pb>
<p>Gossip Girl here, welcoming you to the world of Bloody Mary. She may not like the name, but what else would we give the woman who killed to get to the throne and keeps on killing? Mary’s deadly eye for Protestants and dissenters is keeping me on the lookout these days. You better watch out too, Lizzie–she might take an ax to you next. XOXO, Gossip Girl.</p>

<pb>Religious Turmoil in Elizabeth I’s Reign</pb>
<p>Spotted: the Religious Roller Coaster. Strap in Englishmen, this ride is leaving the station. Would you like to sit with the Catholics, the Protestants, or the extremists on either side? The royal house is with the Reformers, but the queen says you can sit wherever you want–for now. I’ve got sources that say a red-headed cousin from Scotland wants to take over the ride and only let Catholics on. Is Elizabeth strong enough to push her onto the tracks and hold on to her seatbelt? XOXO, Gossip Girl</p>


<pb>Succession Crisis in Elizabeth I’s Reign</pb>
<p>Spotted: a succession crisis and a single queen. England still has no heir to the throne and a queen who gets older by the day. My sources in the castle are telling me two things: Elizabeth can’t find a royal match and she’s not alone in her bed chamber. Better pick it up, Lizzie, or we won’t have any more Tudors to the throne. In other news, has anyone seen her Master of Horse lately? Something tells me he’s familiar with the queen’s situation. XOXO, Gossip Girl</p>

<pb>End of the Tudor Dynasty</pb>
<p>Hold onto your corsets, Englishmen: a new dynasty is upon us again. The Tudors are dead, long live the Stuarts. I’m sure we’re all shaking in our drawers at the thought of the Scot ruling the country, but maybe this is a chance for some peaceful unity. What could possibly go wrong? It’s not like we’ve ever executed a monarch before. XOXO, Gossip Girl.
