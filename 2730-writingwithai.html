Writing With an AI: Reflection
</h1>
<h2>As part of our class, we were required to use an AI to write one of our assignments or at the very least, start one of our assignments. Below is my reflection to using ChatGPT to start my writing remix assignment, which can be viewed <a href="2730-writing%20remix.html">here</a></h2>
<pb>Assignment specific reflection</pb>
    <p>
	I went into this assignment with as open a mind as possible. I have strong feelings about the use of AI in the creative world beyond brainstorming, but for the sake of the assignment I tried to get an output from the AI that I felt really good about only changing minorly. However, I fear that my need for control and personal flair took over and I became frustrated by the fact that the ChatGPT couldn’t read my mind and didn’t understand my prompt the way I understood my prompt. 
<p>
I felt that using ChatGPT from a UX/UI standpoint was definitely easy and quick. Copy and pasting my Change and Continuity in Tudor England essay was very easy and as was editing my prompt to try and get better responses out of ChatGPT. I mostly enjoyed the brainstorming aspect of ChatGPT. Seeing what my results may look like allowed my idea to evolve from an Instagram carousel to a Gossip Girl Blast. However, as time went on I started to get frustrated. I didn’t understand how to make myself clearer, and ChatGPT didn’t understand why I didn’t like what it was saying. This is when I felt I had to abandon ship and use what ChatGPT had given me as inspiration, but not gospel. 
<p>
At times, it seemed like all ChatGPT did was take sentences from my writing and add a “holy cow” or “upper east siders” to it (also, ChatGPT seems to think Gossip Girl uses a lot of exclamation points, which I don’t agree with) so I wasn’t very fond of the output. Since my goal was to write a more casual piece, I think ChatGPT also failed because it didn’t restructure my academic writing to fit the necessary prompt. I am, however, fond of what ChatGPT inspired me to write and I did use some of its Gossip Girl-isms to write my piece. 
</p>
<pb>AI Reflection</pb>
<p>My preconceived notions about AI were both right and wrong. I thought it would be a lot dumber than it was based on the memes I see. But I was also pleasantly surprised to see it pull out the most relevant information from my essay to try and use in the Gossip Girl rewrite, which in turn helped me in the writing process to see what was the most important to include. However, it also pulled quotes I used in the essay without citing them, which did lead to confusion on my part. In defense of ChatGPT, I think it’s also reasonable to say that not every person is capable of writing in the style of Gossip Girl (including myself) and it would take a great deal of training for an AI to be able to write in a specific voice, so I’m not necessarily surprised at how difficult it was for the AI to imitate.
<p>
As for using AI in the classroom, I think that our set-up is the best but likely the one that will be used the least. More and more students are turning in ChatGPT essays that are poorly written and more and more teachers and banning AI entirely from their classrooms (based on my echochamber, Twitter). If teachers are welcoming of AI and teach their students the proper uses, the dangers, and allow them to use it in specific contexts and require them to disclose when AI is used, I think that AI could be beneficial to learning and also teaching students how to edit as well as brainstorm. However, the slope is very slippery and I can see a lot of students falling down it by not being honest and disclosing their AI use. That, to me, is when AI becomes cheating. 
<p>
I think the world should be careful about using AI and never rely on it. AI’s should never be relied on as a primary source of information since it is so easily wrong and misled; our citation exercise in class is a great example. However, I think that using AI as a starting point, much like Wikipedia, can lead to really valuable brainstorming exercises and learning opportunities. Relying on AI, however, to write academic essays with no editing, solve equations, and research without fact checking could be disastrous for the user.
